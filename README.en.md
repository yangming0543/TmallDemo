# Imitation Tmall Mall
Mini Tmall Mall is a comprehensive B2C e-commerce platform based on the SSM framework. The requirements design mainly refers to the shopping process of Tmall Mall: users start from registration, complete login, browse products, add to the shopping cart, place orders, confirm receipt, and evaluate a series of operations. As one of the core components of the simulated Tmall mall system, the Tmall data management backend using the SSM framework includes modules such as product management, order management, category management, user management, and transaction volume statistics, achieving one-stop management and maintenance of the entire mall. (For reference only, if you have any questions, please forgive me! If you think it's good, please help recommend it. Thank you all handsome guys and beautiful women!)

The backend page is compatible with modern browsers such as IE10 and above, and Chrome, Edge, and Firebox perform best.
